The PHP practice project is a web application designed to enhance coding skills and understanding of web development using PHP. The project consists of several key pages:

1. **Dashboard**: This is the landing page after login. Currently, it is empty and serves as a placeholder for future content or widgets that might provide an overview of the user's activities or tasks.

2. **Add Tasks**: This page features a form that allows users to input and submit new tasks. The form collects necessary task details which are then stored in the database.

3. **Tasks**: On this page, users can view a table listing all the tasks retrieved from the database. It serves as a task management interface, allowing users to keep track of their tasks easily.

4. **Edit Tasks**: This page enables users to modify existing tasks. Users can select a task, edit its details, and update the information in the database.

5. **Login and Signup**: These pages provide secure user authentication. The login page allows existing users to access the site, while the signup page enables new users to create an account. Both functions are implemented efficiently, ensuring smooth and secure user access.

This project serves as a practical exercise in PHP, providing hands-on experience with database interactions, form handling, user authentication, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
